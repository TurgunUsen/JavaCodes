## Task 1: Library Management System

Create a simple Java program that simulates a Library Management System. This program will allow you to:

- **Store a list of books** using an `ArrayList`.
- **Manage a list of borrowed books** using a `HashSet` (since borrowed books should be unique).
- **Track book borrow requests** in the order they are received using a `Deque`.
- **Keep track of how many copies** of each book are available in the library using a `HashMap`.

---

### Features

1. **Book Storage**: Maintain a list of books in the library.
2. **Borrowed Books Management**: Ensure each borrowed book is unique.
3. **Borrow Request Tracking**: Keep track of the order in which books are requested.
4. **Availability Tracking**: Monitor the number of available copies for each book.

## Task 2: Two Sum Problem

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

- You may assume that each input will have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.
- You can return the answer in **any order**.

### Example Solution Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        // Method implementation here
    }
}

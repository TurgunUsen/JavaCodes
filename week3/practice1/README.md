# Student Grades Program

Create a program that stores student names (as keys) and their grades (as values) using a `HashMap`. The program should:

1. Add students and their grades to the `HashMap`.
2. Display all students and their grades.
3. Search for a specific student and display their grade.
4. Remove a student from the `HashMap`.
5. Check if a particular student exists in the map.
